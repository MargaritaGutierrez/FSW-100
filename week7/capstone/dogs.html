                    <p>Our program is here to rescue dogs of all breeds and prepare them to be loved by not only those with desire to love them, but also those who are in need of their skilled behaviour.</p>
                    <p>We focus on the dog first. Our job is to find dogs that are less likely to be successfully rehomed, due to breed, age, genetic traits and undesirability</p>
                    <p><span class="font">NEXT, (and this the real kicker!!!)</span>We train these poor pups at any age to be, with love and compassion, service dogs for all different ailments!</p>
                    <p>We train for emotional assistance, physical assistance of many kinds (including seizure detection!!), PTSD, and the list continues!</p>

                <main><span class="font">Here are some questions you will encounter on your evaluation journy!</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>When did you first consider a rescue service pup?</li>
                        <li>How did you find our companion program?</li>
                        <li>Was a companion recommended to you?</li>
                        <li>Are you willing to do an animal abuse background check?</li>
                        <li>What are your specific needs from a service companion?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These are a few of what you will be asked. Please be aware as these questions may become personal, however, they are for us to find your best match so home is a place where everyone can be safe and comfortable! </p>
                    <p><span class="font">Ready to take the next step? </span>Click below to schedule your evaluation with one of our trained staff members!!! (no... not the pup yet... I know... I know... it's a process...)</p>

                <div class="side2"><span class="font">What Dog Will I Get???</span>
                    <p>Look at you! You've come this far! It seems you may have found the right program for you!!!</p>
                    <p>Now you're wondering..."What kind of dog will i get? Maybe a poodle? a maleese? ooh, a german shepard!!!!???" And I am here to answer just that!</p>
                    <p>I cannot tell you what breed, age, color, or any other variable. The dogs from our program have a very wide and ever changing background. We are not breeders, we are rescue teams and service trainers. We may have the perfect pup for you, waiting for the perfect home, when you call!!! However due to how specific we are to find the perfect forever homes, we may not have a pup ready for your home and the wait will be 4-6 months at times.</p>
                    <p>When you call we will do the assessment then recommend up to three of the "standard trained" pups we have available. After that if chosen we will train the pup just for you and your needs.</p>
                    <p><span class="font">Lastly!!!</span>(YES! WERE ALMOST THERE!) We will meet you in our training area and teach you how to communicate with your new pup, to ensure the best possible relationship most beneficial to you and your pup! </p>
                    <p><span class="font">The True Bond Connection Test!!!</span>Once the communication learning is completed we will all travel to a busy location, a grocery store or maybe a mall, at this time we will help you to remember ques you've learned and how to apply them in public.</p>
                    <p><span class="font">It Is time!</span>Now you are ready to venture out with your new furry family member!</p>
